Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
The challenge was to refactor a marketing firm's web page using the tools we have gained thus far in the bootcamp but also doing some research for ourselves to solve the bugs in the provided code. the most important tool I used was definitely the Chrome dev tool's it truly allowed for precision and was effective in catching bugs. For example, I placed my main closing tag near the body closing tag thinking it was appropriate for it to be one big section, however, my aside content did not load properly and it took me quite a bit to solve but thankfully using the Chrome dev tools the answer to the bug clicked and the approperiate tags are in their place, hopfully.
